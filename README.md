A+ CHAOS ID CORE (V122 GOLD MASTER)Status: PRODUCTION LIVEArchitecture: AI-Native / Quantum-Resistant / Behavior-AwareOwner: A+ Overhead Garage DoorsDirective: "Never Stop Running."🏛️ Executive SummaryCHAOS ID is a proprietary Identity Provider (IdP) designed to solve the "AI Identity Crisis." Unlike traditional systems that rely on static passwords (which can be stolen) or simple 2FA (which can be phished), CHAOS ID uses Multi-Factor Biometric Fusion (MBF) and Temporal Behavioral Analysis (DREAMS V4) to prove humanity.We do not just verify access; we verify intent.The 4 Pillars of ChaosABYSS (The Ledger): A geo-partitioned, serializable state machine that guarantees global consistency for billing and identity.NIGHTMARE (The Firewall): A self-healing defense mesh that detects and neutralizes botnets, scrapers, and replay attacks in <2ms.DREAMS V4 (The Brain): A cognitive behavioral engine that analyzes the physics of user interaction (Kinetic Totem) to detect synthetic AI agents.CHAOS PULSE (The Heart): A high-entropy cryptographic generator (Chi-Squared ~13.34) that mints rolling session tokens, making replay attacks mathematically impossible.🛠️ Deployment ProtocolThe Core is designed to run on Render (Node.js) with CockroachDB (State) and Redis (Speed).1. InstallationThe system uses npm for dependency management.npm install
npm start
2. The Vault (Environment Variables)CRITICAL: Do not hardcode secrets. Use Render's "Environment" tab.VariableDescriptionSecurity LevelADMIN_CRED_IDYour Biometric DNA (ID String). Generated via /app registration.CRITICALADMIN_PUB_KEYYour Public Key (Base64). Generated registration.CRITICALADMIN Superuser password for the Key Forge Portal.HIGHX-CHAOS-MASTER-KEYFallback key for system resets.HIGHNODE_ENVSet to production to enable Helmet security headers.LOW🎮 Operational Manual1. The Secure Gate (Login)URL: /appMethod: The Kinetic Totem.Action: Swipe the Green Fingerprint icon UP.Slow Drag: System analyzes micro-tremors (Humanity Check).Fast Flick: System analyzes ballistic trajectory (Intent Check).Status:Green: System Ready.Blue: System Empty (Needs Imprint).Red: Access Denied / Server Asleep.2. The Overwatch Terminal (Monitoring)URL: /adminAccess: Requires Biometric Auth (must login at /app first).Usage: Real-time visualization of threats, traffic, and revenue.Live Terminal: Watch Nightmare block bots in real-time.Health: Monitor p99 Latency and DREAMS baseline.3. The Key Forge (Revenue)URL: /admin/portalAccess: Password Protected (ADMIN_PASSWORD).Usage: Mint secure API keys for external partners and integrations.Manages dynamic access tiers.Enforces proprietary quota logic.Revocation authority for compromised endpoints.4. Integration SDK (Partners)URL: /sdkUsage: Public documentation for developers. Contains the chaos-sdk.js copy-paste snippet.🚨 Security ProtocolsSystem Lockout & RecoveryIn the event of device loss or credential desynchronization, the system enters a Fail-Secure state.Recovery requires the Master Key (X-CHAOS-MASTER-KEY) and direct server access.Refer to internal "Hydra Recovery" documentation (Classified).Server Sleep StateIf the Status Dot is Red, the cloud instance may be dormant.Use the "WAKE SERVER" trigger on the login gate to re-initialize the Abyss connection.🔬 Forensic Verification (Benchmarks)To prove the system's security to investors, run audit_entropy.js in the browser console.Target Metrics:Chi-Squared Score: < 50 (Indistinguishable from true randomness).Collisions: 0 (Uniqueness verified).Bit Balance: ~50.00% (Zero bias).Throughput: > 60,000 Ops/Sec (Hypersonic).CONFIDENTIALITY NOTICE:This codebase contains proprietary algorithms (DreamsEngine, TotemHarmonic).Do not publish index.js source code to public repositories.Only the chaos-sdk.js file is cleared for public distribution.© 2026 A+ Overhead Garage Doors.
